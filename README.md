# ng-leaderboards
This is an implementation of the meteor leaderboards made with angular meteor http://angular-meteor.com/
Check it out on http://ng-leaderboard.meteor.com/

It is a great start to understand how angular-meteor differ from core meteor blaze templates. 
For that reason I have left the blaze code as comments in the controller. 
I will probably blog about it at some point. 

If you think it can be done smarter using angualr-meteor - please PR.
